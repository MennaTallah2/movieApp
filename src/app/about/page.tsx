          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
          has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making
          it over 2000 years old. Richard a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
          College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
          consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites
          of the word in classical literature, discovered the source. Lorem
          Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of The Extremes of Good
          and Evil by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the
          theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
          of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit", comes from a line in section
          1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
          reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
          from by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
          accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by.
